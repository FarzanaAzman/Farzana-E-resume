I have done so many programs in many aspects such as sports and professional course. Eventhough, I am just 21 years old I have several working experience thats is I have working experience as a part timer in Kenny Roagers Restaurant in 2019 during my midsem break. Moreover, as for the skills, it is divided into two part that is Hard Skills and Soft Skills. Hard skills are those talents and abilities that can be measured. They are usually specific to a particular job, and they can be learned through schooling or on the-job-training while soft skills are less defined skills that often apply not only to one specific job but are universal. Hard skills are much easier to quantify and measure. These are things that employees are specifically trained for such as computer skills.  Next,  soft skills are skills and abilities that are much harder to measure and a bit fuzzier to define. As for my E-resume, these are my soft skills and hard skill that I gained and implied :-</h1></p>
